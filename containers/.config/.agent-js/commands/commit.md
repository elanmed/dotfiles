Run `git log --oneline -20` to see previous commit messages and understand the style.

Run `git diff --staged --name-only` to check if there are any staged files.

If no files are staged, run `git add -A` to stage all changes.

Run `git diff --staged` to see the changes.

Look at the changes and decide:

- If changes are related and belong together, create a single commit
- If changes affect different areas (e.g., tests vs source, docs vs code, unrelated features), create separate commits

When splitting into multiple commits:

- Stage files for the first logical group with `git add <files>`
- Commit with an appropriate message
- Repeat for each group

Write commit messages that:

- Use conventional commit format: `<type>: <description>`
- Common types: `add:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `tests:`, `misc:`
- Use lowercase only
- Use commas to separate multiple changes in one commit
- Fit on a single line
- Are descriptive but concise

Commit immediately without asking for confirmation. After committing, show the commit message and ask the user if they want to change it. If they do, run `git commit --amend -m "<new message>"` using exactly what they provide. If they ask another question or change the topic, move on.
